<p>Hi {{ email }} --</p>

<p>I want to thank you for your generous donation to Mozilla. Your support means so much to our organization, because you're helping us continue our mission to build and protect an open Web.</p>

<p>We believe the Internet is more than a technology; it's a public resource. It's a shared force for good.</p>

<p>Thanks again for all that you do to support Mozilla. Together, we will keep the Internet open, accessible, transparent and safe.</p>

<p>Mark Surman
<br>Executive Director
<br>Mozilla Foundation</p>

<p><strong>HERE IS A TRANSACTION RECEIPT FOR YOUR RECORDS:</strong></p>

<p>On {{ transaction_date }} you made a charitable contribution to Mozilla Foundation of {{ bitcoin_amount }} bitcoins with transaction ID {{ transaction_id }}, which our bitcoin wallet provider valued at ${{ usd_amount}} USD. </p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION:</strong></p>

<p>The Mozilla Foundation is a California non-profit corporation exempt from United States federal income taxation under IRC 501(c)(3) and a public charity classified under IRC sections 170(b)(1)(A) and 509(a)(1). Bitcoin donations Mozilla receives are considered charitable contributions under U.S. federal tax laws, to be used in its discretion for its charitable purposes. However, donations of property such as bitcoin are sometimes subject to special rules as to the amount of the deduction or the documentation that must be provided to claim the deduction. (See http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc506.html for an overview). Donors of bitcoin should consult a tax advisor on the extent to which they may deduct charitable contributions of property such as bitcoins and the documentation required in order to claim a deduction. While the Mozilla Foundation is happy to provide any necessary confirmation of receipt of the donated property upon request, any other documentation (e.g., an appraisal) remains the donorâ€™s sole responsibility.</p>

<p>For bitcoin contributions valued at over $5,000 USD, Mozilla expects to file a Form 8282 with the IRS in connection with its disposition of your bitcoin donation. Please provide your name, address, and tax identification number so that we can properly complete our tax forms. If we do not hear from you within 120 calendar days from the date of your donation, we will file the form using our best available information.</p>
